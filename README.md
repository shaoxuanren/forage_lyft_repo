The code of my virtual internship at Lyft.  It invovled:

1) proposing a clean design for a messy component by drafting a UML class diagram 
2) refactoring a messy system using the factory patterns
3) Write unit tests for a newly refactored system
4) Add new functionality using a test-driven development workflow
